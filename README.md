# QuantumVerse-NLP

## Overview

**QuantumVerse-NLP** is an innovative project that integrates Quantum Computing with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This project leverages the power of quantum mechanics to enhance language processing tasks, providing a unique approach to AI-driven text generation.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Computing Integration**: Utilizes quantum circuits for advanced computation.
- **NLP with GPT-Neo**: Employs the GPT-Neo model for generating human-like text.
- **Interactive GUI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time interaction.

## Quantum Circuit

The project uses PennyLane for quantum circuit implementation, with a focus on manipulating color codes and amplitudes.

```python
@qml.qnode(qml_model)
def quantum_circuit(params, color_code, amplitude):
    # Quantum circuit implementation
```

## NLP Model

GPT-Neo, a powerful language model, is used for text generation, enhanced by quantum-influenced logits.

```python
model = GPTNeoForCausalLM.from_pretrained('EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m').to(device)
```

## GUI

The GUI, built with Tkinter, offers an interactive platform for users to engage with the quantum-enhanced NLP model.

```python
root = Tk()
# GUI setup code
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install torch pennylane transformers
```

## Usage

Run the main script to launch the GUI:

```bash
python main.py
```
